**Abstract.** Theaimofthispaperistoanalysemetabolicinter- action between Paris and the Seine during the industrial era, 1790–1970, a period marked by strong population growth, technological changes, and the absence of specific legisla- tion on environmental issues. The viewpoint focuses on ex- changes of waters and wastes between city and river, quan- tifying them and tracing their evolution in the light of the strategies implemented by the stakeholders in charge. The study combines industrial ecology, local history and the his- tory of technology.

From 1790 to 1850, waste matters, and especially excreta, were considered as raw materials, not refuse: they generated real profits. The removal of human excreta aimed not only at improving urban hygiene, but at producing the fertilizers needed in rural areas. Discharging them into the river was out of the question. But after the 1860s, several factors up- set this exploitation, notably domestic water supply: night soil became more and more liquid, difficult to handle and to turn into fertilizer; once utilised, the water had to be re- movedfromthehouse; atthesametime,theseweragesystem developed and had negative impacts on the river. Even so, Parisian engineers continued to process sewage using tech- niques that would not only ensure hygiene but also conciliate economic and agricultural interests: combined sewerage sys- tem and sewage farms. Both of these early periods are thus noteworthy for a relative limitation of the river’s deteriora- tion by urban wastes. Not until the 1920s, when domestic water supply had become the standard and excreta came to be considered as worthless waste, was the principle of val- orisation abandoned. This led to important and long-lasting pollution of the Seine (despite the construction of a treatment plant), aggravating the industrial pollution that had been in evidence since the 1840s.

Analysing the priorities that led to the adoption of one principle or another in matters of urban hygiene and tech- niques, with the causes and consequences of such changes, enables us to understand the complex relations between Paris and the Seine. From raw material to waste matter, from river to drain, the concept of quality in environment remains the underlying theme.

The history of the Industrial Revolution and of its impact on environments is often summed up as an accelerating deteri- oration of the latter, due to the intensification and diversifi- cation of human activities. Anthropogenic pressures appear to have grown relentlessly from the late 18th century to the 1970s and even later. Rivers in particular, as natural recepta- clesforliquidwastes, sufferedearlyandcontinuousdegrada- tionasaresultofincreasesinurbanpopulationandindustrial production. This was all the more so since no consideration was given to problems engendered by pollution, hygienist models being content to clean up cities to the detriment of “residual” spaces (Neri Serneri, 2001). Cities thus became parasite ecosystems (Odum, 1989), living at the expense – *inter alia* – of river systems.

This being said, a more precise study of urban metabolism (Wolman, 1965; Kennedy et al., 2007), focusing on the long term(TarrandAyres, 1990; Tarr, 2002; Douglasetal., 2002), creates a different impression, especially if the quantification of the exchange of materials – which constitute the most tan- gible link between societies and nature, cities and rivers – is accompanied by an analysis of the priorities that guided decision-makers in supplying the water and removing the urban wastes that generated these material flows. In other words, our main thesis is that the degradation of rivers was

not as continuous, systematic and deliberate as it appears at first sight. The aim of this study then is to investigate the case of Paris and the Seine, a thoroughly representative ex- ample of the issues at stake in an approach of this kind, Paris being the main built-up area of the Seine basin besides be- ing the capital, and as such liable to adopt particularly strin- gent norms in matters of public health. The period of refer- ence – 1790–1970 – covers both the first- and the second- phase Industrial Revolution, and ends at a time when the first environment-related laws were voted in France. What is at stake is to understand the interactions between Paris and the Seine, on the basis of the exchanges of matters, in the course of the industrial era, which was marked by sharp in- creases in population (Fig. 1), prior to systematic legislation on environment-related issues.

The study is based on a combination of methods derived from industrial ecology, in particular material balance sheets (Ayres and Simonis, 1994); urban history, which enables us to identify the major transformations of urban structures and the players involved in their different roles (see for instance Paris, 1990; Fierro, 1996); and the history of technology, by which we gain an understanding not only of the reasons be- hind the decisions made by people in charge but also of the functioningofonetechniqueoranother, andofrepercussions intermsofquantitiesofmatters(seeforinstanceBillenetal., 1999; see also, more generally, Melosi, 1990). It draws on detailed and systematic empirical studies on water and nutri- ent flows in Paris (Barles, 2002a, 2007) and combines them with an analysis of changes in policy, technology and insti- tutional settings concerning urban excreta (Barles, 2005a, b; Barles and Lestel, 2007). It proceeds by the exploration of public archives (in particular Paris Archives series VO3), of public statistics, and of the technical literature. The origin and quality of the quantitative sources is discussed in Bar- les (2007), the other sources are fully presented in Barles (2005a).

Section 1 depicts the situation in Paris before the general- ized spread of water supply and sewers, that is to say from the 1790s to the 1850s, when urban wastes were considered as raw materials and not as refuse. After the 1860s (Sect. 2) a number of factors called into question traditional methods of dealing with urban wastes. Even so, Parisian engineers of the daychosetoapplytechniquesfortreatingsewagethatconcil- iated the exigencies of public health with economic and agri- culturalinterests. Bothoftheseearlyperiodsarethusmarked by a limitation of the Seine’s deterioration by urban wastes. Indeed, not until the 1920s (Sect. 3), when nightsoil came to be considered as worthless, and anthropogenic pressures had got out of hand, was the principle of recycling waste matters abandoned, thus generating widespread and lasting pollution of the river.

2  **1790s–1850s: the age of no waste**
1. So little water

At the end of the 18th century, water consumption in Paris remained low, and direct supply was limited to a few pipes that fed rich residences or monumental fountains. Distribu- tion is estimated at 3106 m3/yr and 14l/cap/day (Cebron de Lisle, 1991), and relied on the tapping of springs (Belleville, Pre-Saint-Gerv´ ais, Arcueil) and on machines that drew water from the Seine (Chaillot and Gros Caillou steam pumps, hy- draulic machine at Notre-Dame bridge). Ordinary daily con- sumption was ensured by the gathering of rainwater, by di- rect drawing from the Seine, by the labour of water-carriers, and most of all by private wells, of which an inventory made in 1834 counted 22100, about as many as there were houses (Guillerme, 2007). Overall consumption is not di- rectly known, but it was nonetheless limited, even if there were a great many users: the urbanites of course (Fig. 1), but also their animals. In the years 1790–1800, there were one- and-a-half to two thousand cows and fifteen to twenty thou- sand horses stabled in Paris, not to mention far greater num- bers of livestock in transit, whether for transport or butchery (Barles, 2007), all of which had to be watered.

However, scientists, doctors, engineers, architects and travellers had long denounced the filth of the capital – “in Paris, it is too far or too dirty wherever you are, because in Paris the mud defies description”, wrote Mozart in 1778 – and insisted on the necessity of using powerful currents of water (and air) to clean it up and make it healthy. The canal de l’Ourcq (an affluentof the Marne), which was constructed from 1802 onwards, was designed to meet these ends. In this way a service was set up that was doubly public: first, be- cause it was managed by the Parisian technical services that had been founded and kept up since the Premier Empire, sec- ond,becauseitwasdestinedtothecleaningandenhancement of public space. London, where water supply was already in the hands of private companies and for the service of private

owners, was considered to be a counter example by French engineers, who railed against the debasement of urban hy- giene that resulted from this choice (Emmery, 1840).

When the Parisian water supply network came into service, in 1823, the production capacity increased to 7106 m3/yr (Recherches, 1823) before jumping to 32106 m3/yr in 1825, 90% of which came from the Ourcq (Emmery, 1840). For the most part this network supplied the street fountains that served for cleaning public roads: they were turned on every day for one hour to carry away the rot- ting matter lying on the surface of the roadway and were not accessible to private interests. Added to these were the foun- tains for the use of city-dwellers and water-carriers alike, as well as several monumental fountains: in 1840, Paris had 16 monumentalfountains,84publicfountains,1600streetfoun- tains(ofwhich580underconstructionorplanned)(Emmery, 1840). Industries and trades drew their water directly from the city’s water courses: the Bievre,` the Seine.

In spite of the development of this network, water re- mained rare (Fig. 2). However, it is to be noted that the share of rainwater, which still represented 90% of water in- puts (rainwater and water for consumption) in the capital in 1807, was outstripped by anthropogenic supply in the 1840s.

2. The limited role of sewers

In the early days then, water supply was not coupled with its collecting, so much so that in spite of its relative scarcity wa- ter was omnipresent in public space. Sewers covered barely 20km at the close of the 18th century (Belgrand, 1887), and 40km in 1831 (Emmery, 1834). Rainwater and anthro- pogenic water washed over the ground surface, and flowed in central gutters on streets, often stagnating, soaking away where the ground was still permeable, evaporating and gen- erally contributing to urban humidity, or running off into the Seine *intra muros*. But the perfecting of less costly construc- tion processes (the use of hydraulic lime, and later of ce- ment), the outbreak of cholera in 1832, which caused 18402 deaths in Paris (Rapport, 1834), and the designing of streets with profilesbetter adapted to increases in traffic,soon led to the implementation of the first major programme for laying down sewers, which however, had only modest impact since the network covered only 168km in 1858 (Bulletin, 1865).

Foremost, these sewers were designed to collect rainwa- ter and the cleaning water from street fountains. Thanks to the new profile of streets – a cambered roadway bordered on each side by gutters that separated it from pavements (an early 19th c. innovation) – waters running off could now be channelled and evacuated underground once they had filled their cleansing function. All the skill of the engineers thus lays in choosing the optimal distance between fountain and access to drain. “Without a good system of drains, there can be no good system of water supply”, insisted Darcy (1856).

Thenetworkdidnotcollectdomesticsewage: thesewastes did not exist as waste but as raw materials and fertiliser (see

next section), and did not exist as liquid waste (what is sup- posed to be sewage) as water consumption remained very low in households. Furthermore, up to 1852 the draining of houses was forbidden because it was considered to be un- hygienic, and urban excreta were considered to be solid and useful.

3. Urine and excrement: saleable commodities

Given the techniques implemented in Paris to deal with ur- ban wastes, the city’s river system was little affected. Even so, the question of what to do with the excreta produced by the city was posed, since for the most part they did not end up in the sewage network. In this lies the main distinguishing characteristic of this firstperiod: Paris (and to a lesser extent other French cities and some European ones) produced nei- ther refuse nor wastewaters, but rather raw materials much in demand by both industry and agriculture. All the means implemented to improve the processing of excreta aimed at two objectives that were seen as inseparable and convergent: on one hand urban hygiene, on the other the optimum valori- sation of urban by-products (Barles, 2005a, b).

City-dwellers were duty bound to keep their doorsteps clean by making midden heaps, which were scavenged by rag-pickers(afastdevelopingprofession, whoseprofitscame mainly from the sale of rags and bones) before being shov- elled onto tipcarts by dustmen. The midden residue carted away represented roughly 1l/cap/day, or 0.5kg/cap/day. It was deposited in specific dumps, where it remained for sev- eral years and was transformed into black sludge (as opposed to green, fresh sludge). This end product was then used by farmers in the vicinity of Paris. The agricultural use of sludge, so rich in organic matter, was an age-old practice, and farmers were bound by law to empty the dumps when they became saturated with decaying matter. But a major change came about in the 1770s: sludge, which had always been free, was now sold to farmers by cleaning contractors (Chassin, 1889). In spite of repeated complaints, by the end

of the 18th century the sale of sludge had become the rule. Similarly, cow dung, and horse manure even more, became the object of a lucrative trade, with rising prices. All of these matters, most of which were collected in the public space, were removed from the city, since “Agriculture has found a natural and inexhaustible source of fertility in the prodigious quantity of manure and ferruginous sludge supplied by the city” (Lachaise, 1822).

<a name="_page4_x323.42_y704.41"></a>The use of human urine and excrement for making fertiliz- ers was also a fast developing activity. These matters, which came from dry latrines, were collected in cesspools that were regularly emptied. The product of the emptying was trans- ported to special depots, where as early as 1787 it was trans- formed into *poudrette*, a fertilizer patented in 1796 (Paulet, 1853) and “much in demand by ploughmen” (Thouret, un- dated). Bridet, the inventor of the *poudrette de Montfaucon* (from the name of a depot located on the north-eastern fringe of Paris), earned “enormous profitsby the sale of its products in Normandy and the Brie and Orleans´ countries” (Belgrand, 1887). Urine and excrement were part of an economic circuit (Fig. 3a) that benefitedthe contractors that did the emptying, thekeeperincharge ofthedepot(Bridet, and hissuccessors), and the City of Paris, which rented the land for the depot at a steadily rising rate, bringing in “a revenue by no means negligible” (Paulet, 1853): 64000 French Francs (FF) per year from 1796 to 1805, 166000 FF/yr from 1830 to 1842, 380000 FF/yr from 1842 to 18501.

Nonetheless, malfunctioning existed as of the 1810s. In spite of the low rate of water consumption, certain practices began to gain currency among the leisured classes of society, such as the bath at home. Now, “the bother of emptying the bathtub is of little concern to the sick or sensual man who has a bath carried up to his apartment” (Labarraque, Cheval- lier and Parent-Duchatelet,ˆ 1835), who got rid of the water by way of the latrines. The few houses to benefit from sup- ply by pipes did the same, so much so that the emptying of cesspools became more frequent not only because of pop- ulation growth (Fig. 1), but also due to the fact that there was much more wastewater: 45000m3/yr and 65l/cap/yr in 1815, 90000m3/yr and 117l/cap/yr in 1828, 290000m3/yr and 234l/cap/yr in 1858 (Paulet, 1853; Belgrand, 1887; An- nuaire, 1880). This liquefaction made the fabrication of dry and powdery *poudrette* more difficult, and the problem was clearly identified: “the obstacle faced by the administration at present stems from the mixing of solid matter with liq- uid matter” (Labarraque, Chevallier and Parent-Duchatelet,ˆ 1835). Even so, the general principle was not questioned. In 1833, when an anonymous citizen sent the Seine depart- ment’s health council a memo arguing for mains drainage, his proposition met with a blunt rejection from the commis- sion in charge of examining it, which “considers, that in the present state of affairs, the projects of M. Q... cannot be use- fully applied in Paris; that they are not new; [...] and that his work can be of no use whatsoever to the administration” (Report, 1833).

Improvements that followed were of two kinds. On one hand, there was a reorganization of installations: in 1818, the Montfaucon depot was doubled by that of Bondy located a few kilometres to the east of Paris, beside the canal de

l’Ourcq (just as in 1831, for reasons of hygiene, the sludge depots were moved further away); the closing of Montfau- con in 1848; the opening of private depots as of 1851; the transport of cesspool sewage by boat and later by pipeline for the liquid part, etc. (Mille, 1854). On the other hand, the companies in charge of sludge depots as well as the cesspool contractors developed a new fertilizer as a complement to *poudrette*, in order to exploit the liquid part. They had fol- lowed closely the work of chemists in France, who had at- tached increasing importance to the fertilizing role of nitro- gen(BarlesandLestel,2007)andwhodefendedtheprinciple of giving back to rural areas those “matters which cities owe to the earth” (Dumas, 1866).

As of the late 1820, the chemist Anselme Payen had at- temptedtoconcentratethesaltscontainedincesspoolsewage by evaporation of water, but the process was considered too costly. Distillation, which was experimented in laboratory by Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1836, showed “that urines from Montfaucon contained enough ammoniac to keep going a factory for extracting this product” (Paulet, 1853). Industrial production of ammonium sulphate soon got under way, and by 1852, the depot at Bondy alone was producing 10000m3 of *poudrette*, 835 tons of ammonium sulphate, 8t of am- monium muriate, and 40t of volatile alkali (Beaudemoulin, 1853). While the *poudrette* was sold in a radius of 200 to 250km around Paris, most of the ammonium sulphate was exported to England. Patents for the fabrication of the best fertilizersofhumanorigincamethickandfast, andthestakes in play were considerable given the increased demand for foodstuffs: it was out of the question that these nutriments be thrown away into the river. This period is thus marked by an increase in the production output of urban fertilizers: analysis in retrospect shows that 20% of the dietary nitrogen (human and animal foods alike) that came into Paris in 1817 returned to agriculture in the form of sludge, manures and fertilizers of human origin, 24% in 1869 (Table 1).

3  **1860s–1910s: liquid fertilization**

The valorisation of urban excreta reached its peak in the 1850s and 60s. However, several factors were to compro- mise this circulation of matter between the city, industry and agriculture, which relied on exchanges and limited emissions of liquid waste.

1. Domestic water supply and underground drains

The point of view of the Parisian authorities as to the advis- ability of domestic water supply changed in the 1860s. Their doubly public service (see Sect. 2.1) had proved to be costly, all the more so since it generated no revenue at all, this at a time when the City of Paris, which had absorbed its outly- ing communes in 1860, saw its area grow from 3400ha to 7800ha and its population from 1.25 to 1.67 million inhab-

itants (Fig. 1). Apart from this, it had become abundantly clear that the fight for hygiene did not stop at the doorways of buildings, and the question of unhygienic dwellings was all the more pressing. Besides which, among the bourgeoisie there was a growing demand for comfort. Lastly, the inces- sant coming and going of water- and bath-carriers in streets and houses was increasingly considered to be a nuisance. All of these factors argued in favour of the development of do- mestic water supply, a project carried forward by Eugene` Belgrand, the engineer in charge of waters and sewers in Paris.

Local production capacity soon proved to be insufficient: water would have to be sought elsewhere. Hence the tapping of distant springs that got under way in the 1860s (some of which over 100km from Paris), the installation of new wa- terworks to exploit the Seine and the Marne, and the dual network that still benefits the capital today: the canal de l’Ourcq for bulk water used for cleaning streets and water- ing gardens; springs and rivers for other uses. Hence too the swift increase in domestic consumption, and the setting up of the Compagnie Gen´ erale´ des Eaux to sell water in Paris, the City’s technical services retaining control of production, supply and infrastructures. Production capacity stepped up to 164106 m3/yr in 1875, and to 270106 m3/yr by the end of the 19th century (Cebron de Lisle, 1991). By the eve of the First World War, the present-day structure of water supply was already in place and consumption had risen to between 300 and 350l/cap/day (of which about a third was spring wa- ter, Fig. 2).

In parallel, a restructuring of the sewer network got un- der way. Belgrand’s predecessors had designed it with an eye to limiting overall length: only half the streets were drained. But in 1852, when the disposal of domestic wastew- aters (with the exception of those from latrines) via the sewer became compulsory, to limit direct spilling onto clean streets (Haussmann, 2000), the general draining of Paris became necessary. What is more, the network, which comprised a great number of outfalls to the Seine, was unified, and wastewaters were channelled downstream from Paris to limit contamination of the river and flood risks *intra muros*. The mainsewerofAsnieres,` withitsoutfallintheSeineatClichy, was built in 1858, while the Left Bank linked up with it af- ter crossing under the river by means of a siphon (Fig. 4). By 1877, 6500 hectares were serviced by the sewer network, which covered 570km (Belgrand, 1887); and 1240km in 1914 (Annuaire, 1914).

2. The shortcomings of the traditional system

These changes had considerable impact on the relations be- tween the capital and her river. In effect, the role played by sewers had become more and more important as they shifted an increasing amount of water – 86103 m3 in 1868 (Annu- aire, 1880). This water was sullied by sand and mud due to the spread of macadamized roadways (made of broken

stones) and the intensification of traffic that wore down their surface (macadamized streets totalled 1 million square metres in 1857, 2 million in 18722), by organic matters due to industrialization, by the presence of more horses (54300 in 1874, but more by far moving about in the streets), and by the adjunction of domestic wastewaters. The situation was all the more alarming in that contamination of the Seine by industrial activities had been signalled as of the late 1840s (Lestel, 2005). The coming into service of the Asnieres` main had as immediate effects the swift decline in the quality of water, the formation of shoals that endangered navigation, and the multiplication of cases of fever at Clichy, in short, the “pollution of the Seine” (Arnould, 1889).

Other problems faced those in charge of removing urban excreta, and in particular the emptying of cesspools. Lique- faction had intensified: the 1.1106 m3 of nightsoil removed from Parisian cesspools in 1880, equal to a production of 500l/cap/yr (Annuaire, 1880), was twice as much as in 1858. Excesswatersfromdepotswenttothesewerandaddedtothe contamination of the river. In spite of improved processes for making fertilizers, production output remained low: “At Bondy, in 1869, only 1/5 of the nitrogen was used, 1/2 re- turning to the Seine in the form of sluice-waters, and roughly 1/3 being lost by evaporation and decomposition” (Gastinel,

1894). As for *poudrette*, it was steadily losing favour among agronomists: its preparation was described as a “monstrous operation”, “the *ne plus ultra* of waste” (Girardin and Du Breuil, 1885).

Apart from this, fertilizers of other origin had come in for competition. The discovery of fossil deposits of phosphates as of the 1850s showed that cities, with their cesspools and abundance of animal bones, no longer constituted the prime source of phosphorus. Sodium nitrate from Chile, which be- gan to be imported in small quantities in the 1860s, gradu- ally increased its market share (Daujat, 1957). More gener- ally, after the 1880s, mineral fertilizers, which up till then had not been popular in France, found more and more ad- vocates: “With chemical fertilizer we command cultivation, whereas with manure alone it is cultivation that commands us” (Dureau, 1886). Similar evolution is to be observed con- cerning sludge from streets and the products of scavenging.

Lastly, private depots had proliferated around Paris – there were as many as forty-five around 1880 (Jacquemet, 1979). They came in for stiff denunciation from locals because of their stench and lack of hygiene. Emptying operations too came in for the same criticism. In spite of the improvements made, they remained unhygienic. And they slowed down traffic,jamming the city’s already congested streets.

These difficultiesaffected both the makers of urban fertil- izers, since production costs were on the rise while selling

prices fell, and the administration, which had to ensure pub- lic hygiene but made less and less profitfrom urban excreta. As of the 1860s the reform of cesspool emptying was on the agenda. Evenso, thevalorisationofwastesremainedprimor- dial.

3. Main drain and agricultural spreading

The problems posed by disposal into the Seine and those of the traditional methods of emptying cesspools led Parisian engineers to look at urban hygiene from a different angle. As early as the 1860s, two of them, Adolphe-Auguste Mille and Alfred Durand-Claye, became convinced of the neces- sity of mains drainage, that is to say of the evacuation via the sewers of toilet waters as well as domestic wastewater. But they were just as convinced of the value of urban excreta and of the necessity of their agricultural use. To them, the mains drainage project could not be complete unless it were accom- panied by the spreading of wastewaters in sewage farms, a technique that had already been tested in Europe for some thirty years (Mille and Durand-Claye, 1869). The combi- nation of mains drainage and agricultural irrigation would enable them to ensure urban hygiene by doing away with the transportofbarrelstoemptycesspools,encouragethelinking up of dwellings to water supply, thus facilitating interior hy- giene,andlimitthecontaminationoftheSeineandhazardsto navigation – all this while supporting agricultural production and, last but not least, gaining some revenue from excreta in liquid form, the fertilizing value of which was estimated at 0.125FF/m3, given its content in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (Freycinet, 1870).

The ultimate goal of cleaning up the city was clearly stated, and was summed up by the engineer Charles de Fr- eycinet: it was a matter of ensuring continuous circulation of water and the matter that it carried, and this in three phases – the supply of pure water, underground piping or drainage, purification. Indeed: “The third phase of continuous circu- lation, is [...] the purification of sewage, that is to say the puttingbackintotheearthofthemainfertilizingcomponents that it contains, and the returning to rivers of liquids free of their corrupting elements. Today, no one questions the need for this purification. Two imperious reasons support it: hy- giene and agricultural importance” (Freycinet, 1870).

The firstexperimentsbegan inthe late 1860sand Belgrand rallied to this solution in 1870, soon to be followed by the Parisian administration. Even so, the project had many op- ponents, among whom were doctors, fertilizer-makers, own- ers of buildings, and communes concerned by sewage farms (Jacquemet, 1979). Its implementation was delayed, con- nection of dwellings to the sewage network was optional af- ter 1885, compulsory in 1897; the percentage of buildings connected went from 32% in 1900 to 68% in 1914 (An- nuaire, 1900, 1914); while sewage farming sites multiplied downriver from Paris (Gennevilliers was first, then in 1895 Acheres,` then Carrieres-T` riel and Mery-Pierrelaye´ in 1898,

Fig. 4); they peaked at 5100ha early in the 20th century, with a legal proportion of irrigation of 40000m3/ha/yr, six times

the rainfall of Paris (Vincey, 1910).

The urban hydrological cycle was thus profoundly modi- fied: sewers gradually enabled the collection of the majority of rainwater and supply water to the detriment of infiltration (all the more so as tar-sealed roads became more common) and evapotranspiration. The latter phase of the hydrological cycle was shifted as it were to the sewage farms. Further- more, the excellent agricultural and economic advantages of the method became clear. “The quantity of produce is always considerable, at times prodigious. The same ground easily yields two harvests, the same meadow four or five crops of hay inour climates.” The“excellence” ofthe qualityof prod- ucts “is attested not only by the ease with which they are sold on markets and by the prices they command, but even more so by results obtained in competitions and fairs.” (Bech- mann, 1899). Production was abundant. Considering fodder beet alone, the yields gazetted for the 1880s was impressive: 1050q/ha, while in 1885 the yield for the entire Seine de- partment – the best in France – was 619q/ha, 248q/ha for all of France (Statistique, 1886). Although the areas in ques- tion were hardly comparable, they help us to understand the tone of general enchantment... “The entire population owes its well-being to this thorough metamorphosis.” (Baudrillart, 1888)

During a short period – up to World War I –, the treatment capacity bordered on that of the flow rate of Parisian sewers (Fig. 5) and both engineers and agronomists could delight in the effectiveness of sewage farming. Analysis in retrospect shows that 40% of the dietary nitrogen (human and animal foods alike) that came into Paris in 1913 returned to agri- culture, twice the figure for a century before. The sewage farms accounted for almost one half of this transfer of nutri- ments (Table 1). For the year 1906, a more precise balance sheet of the effect of spreading has been drawn up on the ba- sis of data given by the agronomist Paul Vincey (1910). In

1767 S. Barles: Urban metabolism and river systems: an historical perspective

This period nonetheless saw one significant change: whereas the City of Paris had hoped to reap considerable profits from sewage farming, or at least cover expenses, it had to admit that the solution was costly. True, produce was abundant, but it was the farmers who benefited from it even though they contributed little or nothing to irrigation costs, whichprovedtobeveryhigh. Asearlyas1900,revenuefrom the sewage farms and the sale of vegetables grown in model gardens at Gennevilliers and Acheres` amounted to barely 130421 FF, while running costs alone stood at 1875000 FF (Martin, 1902). There was no denying the agricultural and sanitary importance of spreading, but it was no longer ac- companied by economic interest (Fig. 3b).

As well, up until World War I, the City of Paris had been content to implement projects for water supply and drainage that ignored suburban areas, in spite of their rapid growth. There were 1.5 million suburbanites in 1921, 2M in 1931, as against 2.9M inhabitants for Paris *intra muros*, a figure that remained fairly constant between both dates (Fig. 1). Water consumption in the suburbs remained less than that *intra muros* (94l/cap/day in 1900, 150l/cap/day in 1921, 200l/cap/day in 1933, Fig. 6), but the consequences for the Seine were not negligible: the quantity of river water drawn increased, as did the discharge of raw sewage. Added to this overall consumption was industrial demand, also very much on the increase. These problems had been signalled at the

very start of the 20th century: “During the summer of 1900 in particular, pressing complaints were made concerning the persistent infection of the river” (Vincey, 1910). In 1905, the flow rate of Parisian sewers represented 78% of the total for the entire built-up area, but 72% of this wastewater was pro- cessed in the sewage farms, so much so that direct outfall from the suburbs was equal to that of Paris (Vincey, 1910).

In view of this, it became increasingly difficult to act as if the suburbs did not exist. As of 1911, the general council of the Seine department insisted on the need for a cleaning up programme, due to the exhaustion and deterioration of natural resources, a delicate matter after the drought of that same year, during which the Seine literally stopped flowing (Sentenac, 1928).

Yet it was not until the between-war period that these new conditions were taken into consideration. In the meantime, in the 1920s, the situation had grown worse: whereas the Seine’s low-water flow rate was barely 35m3/s, water drawn from the river reached 28m3/s (not counting the quantities drawn by power stations), so much so that the State was forced to refuse a demand by the City of Paris for an increase in the quantities drawn. Elsewhere, the quality of water de- teriorated: increased consumption meant a corresponding in- crease in wastewaters, both urban and industrial, and given theriver’ssluggishflowrateduetothissameincrease,outfall sewage was not diluted. Simultaneously, wastewaters from power stations caused an alarming rise in water temperatures (Sentenac, 1928; Gilbert, 1958).

2. Large-scale solutions

The first remedial projects developed by Parisian authorities reflect continuity in the viewpoints of the city’s engineers, for whom the natural resource was deemed unlimited and the needs of the capital the priority. Since there were no more springs to be tapped (the last diversion was done in 1926), water would have to be brought from further away, in another basin, hence projects in the 1920s and 30s for tapping water from Lake Geneva or the Loire valley (Sen- tenac, 1928; Koch, 1949). But at the same time, an age-old fear had resurfaced: the flood of 1910 had revealed the cap- ital’s vulnerability. The construction of reservoir-dams up- river, already envisaged fiftyyears earlier, appeared to be the solution for safeguarding the city. But the retention capac- ity required demanded enormous investments; so the project was re-oriented and the first dams that came into service in the 1930s were essentially designed to maintain a low-water level that would ensure both navigation and the drawing of water in summer, since supporting the minimum flow-rate demanded a retention capacity far less than that of control- ling floodrisk (Gilbert, 1958).

In parallel, the technical services of the City of Paris sought other sites for sewage farming, further away, where agricultural irrigation might come into its own and real estate pressure did not exist. In the 1920s, they developed plans to

**Fig. 6.** Water production and consumption, Paris and suburbs (other municipalitiesoftheSeine*departement´* ), 1900–1962(adaptedfrom Barles, 2002b).

irrigate the dry Champagne region, which had been devas- tated by WW I trenches, so as to “re-stimulate agriculture on grounds ill-suited for farming, because the soil is too chalky, and thus too dry in summer due to cracking.” (Vedry´ , 1992) Bernard Vedry´ reports that two variant projects were studied, bothofthembasedonbuildinganaqueduct140kmlong,one to the north of Reims, where laid 38000 ha of irrigable land, the other to the south of the Marne, which offered 28000 ha. The problem of removing and processing sewage would thus be solved once and for all, and once again to the benefit of agriculture.

But the sewers of Paris never irrigated the Champagne re- gion. Costs were probably too high, while synthetic fertiliz- ers became more competitive, all the more so given the dif- ficulties encountered in exploiting the sewage farms already in operation and the fact that agronomic science had shown that sewage did not constitute as superior a fertilizer as it had once been thought to be, due to the inadequate propor- tions of its nutrients (Koch, 1937). The very objectives of purification changed, and became far narrowest: according to Pierre Koch, the Seine department’s head of sewerage sys- tem (1937), the central issue was simply to disintegrate or- ganic matter. There was a growing interest in the biological processes of purification, which enabled “the setting to work of the same microbial agents as those that accomplish natural purification, but in such a way as to produce the maximum amount of disintegration of organic matter within the small- est possible space and in the shortest lapse of time” (Cour- mont et al., 1932).

Accordingly, when the general sewerage system scheme for the Parisian built-up area was approved in 1929, a project designed to meet needs up to 1970, the biological treatment of sewage was adopted (Olivesi, 1966). Based as it was on a network of main sewers laid out in fan array, the branches converging at Acheres,` it used the same principle as the Parisian network, but on a larger scale, and introduced the principle of treatment by means of activated sludge. The

Acheres` I wastewater treatment plant, which came into ser- vice in 1942, had a purification capacity of 200000m3/day.

Subsequent extensions made it for a long time the world’s largest treatment plant after that of Chicago.

But as of the plant’s inception, sludge posed a problem. Even if, as of 1944, fermentation produced methane gas, which, once compressed, could be used to run government vehicles (Koch, 1949), this outlet lost its interest at the end of the war. At the same time, the experimental station at Colombes, with a capacity of 6000m3/day, enabled “experi- menting modern processes of sewage treatment and the car- rying out of research into the recuperation of sub-products derived from sewage.” (Koch, 1949). A test-bed garden of 15000 m2 was laid out in an attempt to recycle gas, but to no avail: sludge remained a headache (Olivesi, 1973).

Sewage farming was not abandoned though, even if the farmed areas shrank year by year. 4500 hectares in 1949, 4040ha in 1966, 2000ha in 1983 (Veron,´ 1983): it could not withstand urban and industrial pressure. But it was with regret that the technical services of Paris saw this activity di- minish. In the 1950s and 60s there was still talk of “large yields”, with “often two market garden crops a year”, and it was remarked that sewage farming “contributes, to a consid- erable extent, to supplying the Parisian market and [that it] plays the role of a price regulator.” Attention was drawn to its“particularlyprecious”contributionduringthewar(Koch, 1949; Feuillade, 1966). These commentaries, which ap- peared in special issues that the review *Science et industrie* (later re-named *Travaux*) did on Parisian technical services, were not re-published in the 1973 edition: alas, even if the technique was not truly abandoned until 1999, it was already obsolete.

3. The Seine: river or drain?

In parallel to this, growing discrepancy became apparent be- tween hygiene-related intentions and actual practice. Koch (1937)hadindeedinsistedonthedualnecessityofprotecting both inhabitants and natural environment, when he entitled the second volume of his course: *The protection of natural environments and the treatment of urban effluents* and when he wrote: “as for the purificationof residual waters, we need only look at the state of large or medium-sized rivers down- stream, or even in their crossing of built-up areas which do not take sufficientcare of them, to be persuaded of its useful- ness.”

The texts of State regulations, however, were less affir- mative. In its *Instructions relatives a` l’assainissement de villes* in 1933, the Conseil superieur´ d’hygiene` publique of France asserted that it “could only give its approval to plans that shifted rapidly away from the built-up area all wastewaters, including faeces, eradicating them and moving them to a place where they can not cause harm to anyone.” The *Instruction technique relative a` l’assainissement des ag- glomer´ ations* of 1949 (commonly known as the “Caquot cir-

cular”), mentioned “minimum processing, to be carried out even in the most favourable circumstances” (Ministere` de la Reconstruction et de l’Urbanisme, 1949), but in the final analysis imposed nothing. Technical instructions published the following year (12 May 1950) clearly stated the sani- tary objective, but did not enforce any “obligation of total or partial purification of sewage waters, of which it is, how- ever, simply recommended that the best final destination be sought, whether it be discharge in the sea, in a lake, a pond, a water course or on the ground.” (Loriferne, 1987) The law on water of 19643 introduced the notion of compatibility be- tween wastes and the uses of water, but it was not until 10 June 1976, with the circular of the ministry of Health per- taining to the cleaning up of built-up areas and the protection of the natural environment that the latter was taken into ac- count.

The period 1930–1970 is thus marked by the constant “behind schedule” state of purification measures. Human excreta, having lost all economic and agricultural value, no longer represented a subject of sufficient importance to jus- tify a strong-willed policy. Even the hygienist concerns that attended the subject were probably toned down: the perfect- ing of processes for ensuring the quality of drinking wa- ter and their generalization diverted attention from the poor quality of the resource. Environmental awareness, which we see in Koch, was not yet sufficiently widespread to support the sewage treatment. In this way, the treatment capacity in the Parisian built-up area was for a very long time infe- rior to needs (Fig. 5), and the Seine saw its quality continue to decline. In 1931, it is likely that 36% of the dietary ni- trogen in Paris was evacuated directly into the Seine, a per- centage three times that of 1913 (Table 1), to which must also be added the other sources of nitrogen, both in Paris and her suburbs. The low rate of purification at Acheres` along with the increase in volumes to be processed only served to worsen the state of the river. This urban pollution added to the industrial one – a known but not quantified problem at that time.

Human excreta, which had once contributed to the wealth ofParis,werehenceforthaliability: “Theprocessingofefflu- ents constitutes a charge that built-up areas naturally tend to consider as frustrating, since they make no direct profitfrom it.” (Koch, 1937). At the best, wastes were treated, at the worst, they were abandoned (Fig. 3c). The useless character of sewage paved the way for the invention of a new expres- sion, *eaux usees´* (wastewaters), which was coined by the en- gineerGeorgesBechmannin1899andgainedcurrencyinthe 1930s, at the same time as the expressions *dec´ hets mena´ gers* (household wastes) and *dec´ hets urbains* (urban wastes) for solid excreta (Barles, 2005a).

Even so, up to the 1920s, the people in charge from agricultural activities that was by no means negligible of removing urban and human sewage were not content to (Billen et al., 2007). The picture we have drawn nonetheless simply evacuate it via the river. As in other cities (see for shows that urban impact must be put into perspective.
